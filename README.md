## 1. Business Problem: Mitigating the Impact of Domestic Flight Delays in the US

### Background and Motivation

**Economic and Operational Impact**: Flight delays in the United States represent a significant challenge for the aviation industry, both in terms of operational efficiency and economic cost. Delays not only disrupt airline schedules, leading to increased operational costs, but also affect ancillary services in the aviation ecosystem. The ripple effect of delays can lead to substantial financial losses for airlines and associated businesses.

**Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty**: From a customer perspective, flight delays are a major source of dissatisfaction. Prolonged wait times, missed connections, and disrupted travel plans can significantly impact passenger experience. This dissatisfaction can lead to a decline in customer loyalty and preference, which is crucial in a highly competitive market.

**Predictive Analytics as a Solution**: In an era where data-driven decision-making is paramount, leveraging predictive analytics to forecast flight delays can be a game-changer. By accurately predicting delays, airlines can proactively manage their schedules, allocate resources more efficiently, and inform passengers in advance, leading to improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

**Strategic Decision-Making**: Understanding the patterns and causes of flight delays can aid airlines and airport authorities in making strategic decisions. This includes optimizing flight schedules, improving turnaround times, and enhancing overall airport operations. 

**Regulatory Compliance and Reporting**: Airlines are often subject to regulatory requirements regarding on-time performance and consumer reporting. Predictive models can assist in better compliance management, reducing the risk of penalties and negative publicity.

**Competitive Advantage**: In a competitive industry, airlines that can effectively manage and mitigate flight delays can gain a significant competitive advantage. This advantage is not just in terms of operational cost savings but also in enhancing brand reputation and customer loyalty.

### Project Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to address these multifaceted challenges by developing a robust predictive model using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy. By integrating this model into a user-friendly Streamlit web application, the project aims to provide a practical tool for airlines, airport authorities, and even passengers, offering real-time insights and predictions about flight delays. This tool is not only a step towards enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience but also serves as a valuable asset for strategic planning and decision-making in the aviation industry.

## 2. Solution Strategy

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - The project utilized a comprehensive dataset from DACON, a South Korean equivalent of Kaggle. This dataset comprised an annual record of approximately 1 million rows, detailing domestic flight history in the US. It included departure and arrival information (states, airport codes, flight distance, Estimated Departure Time [EDT], Estimated Arrival Time [EAT]), along with airline details (airline code, airplane tail number).
   - data link: https://dacon.io/competitions/official/236094/overview/description

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset had significant missing data in sections like EDT, EAT, origin_state, destination_state, airline, and carrier_id.
   - For missing EDT and EAT, average flight durations from departure to arrival airports were calculated and used to infer missing values.
   - Missing origin_state and destination_state values were filled using a state:airport dictionary.
   - Airline values and carrier IDs were cross-referenced using an airline:id dictionary.
   - The dataset had imbalanced labels (0: non-delay, 1: delay), so undersampling was performed to balance the label distribution.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - This phase involved visualizing trends, such as identifying months with higher flight frequencies or delay ratios, and examining time-based patterns.
   - Analysis of airlines and states was conducted to determine which had higher flight delay ratios.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Based on insights from the EDA, new features like time_of_day, season, and state_region were created from the raw data to enhance the model's predictive power.

5. **Data Preparation for Machine Learning**:
   - Numeric values were normalized, and categorical variables were label-encoded to prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling.

6. **Machine Learning Modeling**:
   - Models used included Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
   - XGBoost and LightGBM showed the best performance among the models tested.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - This step involved refining the base models to enhance their performance and accuracy.

8. **Model Selection**:
   - XGBoost was selected as the best model for the application, achieving an accuracy of approximately 60-65%.

9. **Model Deployment (Prototype)**:
   - The XGBoost model was deployed using Streamlit for real-time prediction on new data.
   - New, unseen data was used to test the model's efficacy.
   - To reduce the rate of false positives and enhance the model's precision, the decision threshold was adjusted to be more conservative, increasing the specificity of the model. 

Through these steps, the project aimed to create a reliable and user-friendly tool for predicting flight delays, thereby addressing a significant business challenge in the aviation industry. The combination of thorough data preprocessing, insightful exploratory analysis, strategic feature engineering, and careful model selection and tuning culminated in a practical solution for real-world application.

## 3. Data Analysis Insights
- **There is significant imbalance in the data.**
    - The smaller number of 'delayed flights' in our data could negatively impact the model. Requires a balanced sampling method.

## 4. Model Deployment (Streamlit)

### Overview:
- The project utilizes an XGBoost model to predict flight delays.
- The default airline is set to 'JetBlues', which shows up to nearly 20% delay rate annually. 
- When the user provides information about the departure state, arrival state, and departure time, the model provides the probability of the flight's departure delay.
- Based on user input, the app automatically generates columns required for running the ML model.
    - State info is inferred from the airport code.
    - Travel duration is inferred from estimated departure time and arrival time.
    - Flight number (airplane tail number) is randomly generated.
